# YouTube-Comments-Analysis
This project retrieves comments using YouTube APIs and then carries out sentiment analysis and collocation detection to get an overview of the comments section of any YouTuber. The client_secret file is the file which is to be downloaded while creating YouTube API credentials. credential_sample is the file which will be created by the code to automate the authentication process. The language used is Python.
